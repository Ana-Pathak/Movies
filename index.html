                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
                It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
                making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin 
                professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of 
                the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
                 and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
                 discovered the undoubtable source.
